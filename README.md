# Book Inventory App

The book inventory app is a flask app that helps keep record of the books a person has

The technologies used were :
- Ubuntu 23.10 as the development operating system
- python 3.11 as the programming language as it the programming language that I feel most comfortable with  


- The following libraries were used:


        1. alembic==1.10.3: In order to work as a  a support library for flask-sqlalchemy
        2. autopep8==1.6.0: In order to keep it code compliant with the PEP8 requirements 
        3. bcrypt==4.0.1: In order to provide encryption capabilities in further development
        4. flask-admin==1.6.1: In order to provide an admin interface for the flask app, similar to those of many cms such as joomla, drupal, wordpress, or django bring as default
        5. flask-bootstrap4==4.0.2: In order to add better styling and accessibility features to the app,by bringing bootstrap 4 and 5 into the mix
        6. flask-sqlalchemy==3.0.3: In order to model and handle the database 
        7. matplotlib==3.6.3: In order to add plots related to different statistics for what was stored in the database.
        8. mkdocs-material==9.5.9: In order to provide a  look to the documentation similar to that of similar read the docs sites across the internet
        9. mkdocstrings-python==1.8.0: In order to bring docstrings into the documentation site
        10. pandas==2.2.0: In order to handle and prepare different data sources for subsequent processing inside the app
        11. pip-chill==1.0.3:In order to keep the requirements.txt as clean as possible by only listing the installed libraries inside the file without listings those which were installed automatically to support the desired libraries(Eg: listing pandas, without listings numpy, while you installed pandas, numpy gets installed automatically, since the former is fundamental in the functioning of the latter, but you will only list pandas).
